There are a few themes that resonated with me when I watched Mandalorian season 2, almost 3 years ago.

Already like the music and the use of the "volume" technology.


## The politics
Many people don't like the prequels because of too much politics, But I do.
The one with Bill Burr, touches upon many interesting themes -
1. The new republic or the empire, the planets in the outer rim are both ignored
2. The blind faith in one's well, faith. How the Bill Burr character challenges Mandalorian's belief that he cannot be seen without his helmet or any helmet would do.
3. The sheer pride of the imperial officer when he says that people are not looking for freedom but for order. Long live the empire. I felt the depth of the statement along with Bill Burr's penting frustration. Well written, well acted and well executed.


## The aesthetics
Star wars has always been a blend of fairytales, sci fi, western and mystical genres.
